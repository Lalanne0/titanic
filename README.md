## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). It includes the following key features:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Passenger's name.
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender.
- **Age**: Passenger's age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number (if available).
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and place it in the `data/` directory of this repository.

## Usage

### Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and EDA:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

### Train and Test Models
Use the `scripts/` directory for training models. For example:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

### Visualizations
Generate visualizations to understand the data and model performance:
```bash
python scripts/visualize_data.py
```

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights into passenger demographics and survival patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict survival using models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and more.
- **Visualization Tools**: Create charts and graphs for better understanding of the data.
